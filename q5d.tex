Firstly, for the purposes of part (d) (at least the first part of it), it's not the case that both sides are equal to 0. You have to prove that the identity holds for all paths, not just stationary paths. In other words, you cannot use that p-dot = dL/dx, until the very last bit of (d), when you do assume a stationary path. But the original identity must be proved without that. I'd recommend starting from the right hand side and (using the Rund-Trautman identity), show it equals the left.

The \textit{Rund-Trautman identity} is given as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:5.3}
	\pderiv{L}{x}\xi +p\dot{\xi} +\pderiv{L}{t}\tau - H\dot{\tau}=0,
\end{equation}
and from this identity it will be shown that 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:5.4}
	\lr{\xi-\dot{x}\tau}\lrs{\dot{p}-\pderiv{L}{x}} = \deriv{}{t}\lrs{p\xi-H\tau},
\end{equation}
as follows.

For a stationary path 
\[
	\dot{p} = \pderiv{L}{x}
\]
and so \eqref{5.22} becomes
\begin{align}
	\deriv{}{t}\lrs{p\xi-H\tau}&=  \lr{\xi- \dot{x}\tau}\lr{\dot{p} -\dot{p}} = 0,\\
	\deriv{}{t}\lrs{p\xi-H\tau}&= 0.
\end{align}

As the differentiation of a constant is zero, then the expression 
\[
	\deriv{}{t}\lrs{p\xi - \tau H} = 0,
\]
must mean that 
\[
	\boxed{p\xi - \tau H = \text{constant}}.
\]
