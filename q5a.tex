It can be shown that the \el for $S$ is defined by
\[
	\dot{p} = \pderiv{L}{x},
\]
as follows.

The \el is
\begin{align*}
	&\ELEd{L}{t}{x},\\
	&\qtq{which becomes after substituting in the \textit{conjugate momentum,}}\\
	&\deriv{}{t}\lr{p} - \pderiv{L}{x}=0,\qtq{and}\\
	&\deriv{p}{t}-\pderiv{L}{x}=0,\\
	\therefore&\quad \dot{p}=\pderiv{L}{x},\qtq{as required.}
\end{align*}
