Given
\[
	S[x] = \Int{a}{b}{t} L\lr{t, x, \dot{x}},\qtq{with} b>a,
\]
where $L$ is called the Lagrangian, and $x(t)$ is at least twice continuously differentiable.

The \textit{conjugate momentum} $p$ is define by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:5.1}
	p = \pderiv{L}{\dot{x}}.
\end{equation}

It can be shown that the \el for $S$ can be written as
\[
	\dot{p} = \pderiv{L}{x},
\]
as follows.

The \el is
\begin{align*}
	&\ELEd{L}{t}{x},\\
	&\qtq{which becomes after substituting in the \textit{conjugate momentum,}}\\
	&\deriv{}{t}\lr{p} - \pderiv{L}{x}=0,\qtq{and}\\
	&\deriv{p}{t}-\pderiv{L}{x}=0,\\
	\therefore&\quad \dot{p}=\pderiv{L}{x},\qtq{as required.}
\end{align*}
